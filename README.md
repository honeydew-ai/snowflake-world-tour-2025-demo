# Honeydew - Snowflake World Tour 2025 Hands-On Lab

## Introduction

In this session we will:
1. Bootstrap a semantic layer in Honeydew using some pre-created Semantic Views in Snowflake.
2. Iteratively enhance the semantic layer with additional definitions and metadata.
3. Ask complex analytical questions and get insights from the data.
4. See how the same semantic layer can be used in BI tools.

## Setup

1. Signup to the Honeydew demo environment at https://demo.honeydew.cloud/signup
   You will automatically be added to the hands-on lab org, and will be able to explore the environment.
   
2. All the semantic layer metadata created during the lab is stored in this repository.
   You can browse the branches and detect the branch created by your user.

3. During the lab, you will be using a Honeydew-owned Snowflake account.
   If you would like to try Honeydew with your own data and semantics,
   you can sign up to a trial account at https://app.honeydew.cloud/signup.
